IASO is a smart health record management system. It is made to replace the slow, paper based decentralized method of health record management. It is an application that stores the patient health records in a database along with patient info, medical history, scans reports, prescriptions, allergies, genetic disorders in the family and others. Each patient will be identified by a unique id.
