IASO

About IASO
IASO is a smart health record management system. It is made to replace the slow, paper based decentralized method of health record management. It is an application that stores the patient health records in a database along with patient info, medical history, scans reports, prescriptions, allergies, genetic disorders in the family and others. Each patient will be identified by a unique id.

The main functions of the system are:
Medical history: stores the patient’s entire medical history, allergies, prescriptions  which makes it easier for a doctor from any hospital to treat the patient.
Test & Scans: all the patient scans and test data, files will be stored which makes it easier to share to other doctors for opinion, avoid repetition of tests & scans
Prescriptions: Prescriptions are added to the patient account. The patient just have to contact the pharmacy and the medicine listed in the account will be given to the patient. 
Genetic disorders in the family: when a genetic disease is spotted in the family, the relative’s accounts are notified and  prediction of diseases are possible.
Medical Verification: Medical verification for any process can be easily done since all the details are at one place.
Emergency call: Emergency calls can be made to relatives which are added on the list using quick toggle feature in smartphone. 
Call doctors: feature to have video call with specialized doctors
